We were not able to move the "inner" element because it's parent
object "outer" had the default Position value of "relative".

which caused "inner" object to to inherit this static Positioning value
bacause his position value was "Absolute"
which inherits the parent's Position Value.

therefore it was not able to inherit the tblr(in this case top) values.

we can fix it by adding a positioning value of 'absolute' to the 'inner' 
object in order to make him relative in position to its parent elemant
soltion example is attached beloew.
