We were not able to move the "inner" element because it's parent
object "outer" had the default Position value of "Static".

which caused "inner" object to to inherit this static Positioning value
bacause his position value was "Absolute"
which inherits the parent's Position Value.

therefore it was not able to inherit the tblr(in this case top) values.

we can fix the problem by changing the position value
from 'Absolute' to 'Relative' which makes the inner element
affected by tblr properties realtive to its parent.

soltion example is attached beloew.
